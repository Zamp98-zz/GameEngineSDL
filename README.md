# GameEngineSDL
Game Engine developed using SDL with OpenGL and Software Rendering
Current state:
 1 - The perspective is working. 
 <br>
 2 - The camera implementation is almost complete.
 <br>
 3 - There's no z-buffer, textures, and lighting.(Comming soon)
 <br>
 4 - Only software renderer is implemented in single threaded mode.(Multithreading comming soon)
 <br>
 I'm trying to make this engine to maybe port to the PS3 and explode the Cell Broadband Engine.
